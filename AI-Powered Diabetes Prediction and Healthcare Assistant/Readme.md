# 🏥 AI-Powered Diabetes Prediction and Healthcare Assistant

## 📌 Overview

AI-Powered Diabetes Prediction and Healthcare Assistant is an end-to-end Machine Learning and Generative AI application that predicts diabetes risk and provides intelligent medical assistance through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The system combines traditional Machine Learning for diabetes prediction with a local Large Language Model (Llama 3 via Ollama) and a FAISS-powered knowledge retrieval system to deliver personalized explanations and healthcare guidance.
